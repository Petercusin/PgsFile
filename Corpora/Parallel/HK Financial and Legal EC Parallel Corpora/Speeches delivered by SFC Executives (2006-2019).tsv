The common dominator in such cases is that through arrangements orchestrated by the Chairman or other controlling officer of the company, the company’s shareholders funds end up being depleted – perhaps to the extent of threatening the company’s solvency – and neither the executive nor the independent non-executive directors are able to impose any control or limit on the company’s business affairs through questioning the value of the transactions, or doing the due diligence necessary to ascertain their likely benefit to the company.	上述个案的共同点是，透过公司主席或其他持控制权的人员的部署，公司股东的资金最终被掏空(可能达到使公司偿债能力出现危机的程度)，而执行董事或独立非执行董事均不能透过质疑有关交易的价值，或作出所需的尽职审查以确定该等交易可能为公司带来的利益，借以对公司的业务事宜施加任何监控或限制。

The problem in the Bear Stearns episode is not so much valuation but leverage, - one of its hedge funds was geared up 10 times. It was the inability to meet margin calls that led to liquidations that put pressure on the valuation of the remaining collateral, leading to a vicious cycle of further losses and more margin calls.	贝尔斯登事件的问题所在并非估值，而是杠杆借贷――贝尔斯登其中一项对冲基金的投资额曾利用杠杆效应扩大了 10 倍，其后，该基金由于未能偿付被追缴的保证金而引致清盘，从而对余下抵押品的估值造成压力，以致产生进一步亏损和追缴更多保证金的恶性循环。

The removal of these constraints was aimed at facilitating the development of a regional ETF market in Hong Kong within an appropriate regulatory framework and thereby providing wider choices for investors.	消除这些限制，是要在香港合适的规管架构下，促进香港发展为地区性的 ETF 市场，让投资者有更多选择。
These investors must first remit foreign currency for conversion into RMB before they can make RMB investments in Mainland markets;	这些投资者必须首先将外币汇进内地市场，然后兑换成人民币，再将人民币投资于内地市场；

Hong Kong therefore has much to offer in terms of skills, experience and advisory services and can play a key role in advising Mainland institutions seeking to invest overseas, including of course in other Asian markets.	因此，香港不论在技术、经验和顾问服务方面都贡献良多，并且为打算进行海外(当然亦包括在其他亚洲市场)投资的内地机构担当重要的顾问角色。

They are not subject to the same stringent requirements as retail hedge funds. They do not need to be, as private hedge funds target professional institutional investors who should be savvy enough to do their own due diligence, assess the risks involved and monitor the performance of the funds.	它们无须符合适用于零售对冲基金的同一套严格规定，这是因为私人对冲基金的对象是专业机构投资者，而这些投资者理应具备足够的知识，自行作出审慎查证、评估所涉及的风险及密切留意有关基金的表现。

However, if the statutory backing were to be limited to the Listing Rules requiring disclosure of price sensitive information, as opposed to the rules that require disclosure of other information such as related party transactions or major transactions, there would be no certainty that listed companies would be held accountable for making full and frank disclosure to the market.	然而，假如法定效力仅限于《上市规则》内披露价格敏感资料的规定，而不涉及披露其他资料(例如关连方交易或重大交易)的规定，便将无法确保上巿公司会就向巿场作出全面及坦诚的披露而接受问责。
Would there be an open market and an orderly and fair market for the shares?	有关股份是否有一个公开、有序和公平的市场？
Financial services is one of the key industries where Hong Kong enjoys international recognition.	金融服务业是香港备受国际认可的主导行业之一。

For example, New York’s regulatory regime is often cited as one of the reasons for its loss of competitiveness as market participants move their business to jurisdictions such as London where regulation is considered to be more efficient.	举例說，随著市场參与者把业务从紐约转移到倫敦等监管制度更有效率的司法管辖区，紐约的监管制度就常被诟病为导致其市场竞争力下降的一个原因。

(iii) Use of soft commission Soft commission arrangements is another area of concern for regulators as they give rise to conflicts of interest issues between the fund manager (who receive benefits) and the fund and its investors’ interest (in paying the lowest commission rate available and obtaining best execution of the funds’ transactions).	(iii) 非金钱佣金安排 非金钱佣金安排是另一个备受监管机构关注的范畴，因为这些安排在基金经理（收取利益者）与基金及投资者利益（投资者希望支付最少佣金亦同时希望基金交易获得最佳的执行）之间产生了利益冲突的问题。
But we believe that with the co-operation and support of both Taiwan and Hong Kong, we will be able to create an investment environment that will be mutually beneficial to the investors and fund industry in both Taiwan and Hong Kong.	但我们相信，只要得到台港双方的合作及支持，必定可以为台湾及香港的投资者及基金业制造一个互惠互利的投资环境。

Furthermore, there are 12 authorised funds in Hong Kong which mainly invest in Taiwan’s securities market, of which four were just launched in the past three months. This reflects Hong Kong investors’ increasing interest in the Taiwan market.	另外，香港有 12 只主要投资于台湾证券市场的认可基金，而其中有 4 只是在过去 3 个月才推出的，反映香港投资者对台湾市场的兴趣逐渐增加。
When creditors tried to auction the CDOs in an opaque and illiquid market, the salvage value was much lower than expected and creditors sold only a fraction of the assets.	当债权人试图在非公开且不流通的市场拍卖 CDO 时，会发现 CDO 的残值远低于预期水平，而债权人亦只能将欠债人的一小部分资产出售套现。
A number of deficiencies were detected. In particular:	我们发现了多项不足之处，特别是：
As at end of 2007, there were 2,040 SFC-authorised retail funds.	截至 2007 年年底为止，市场共有 2,040 项证监会认可零售基金。
After the Lehman failure, investor confidence across different types of investment products, be it funds or otherwise, became even more fragile.	雷曼集团倒闭后，投资者对包括基金在内的各類投资产品的信心变得更脆弱。
Our thesis has been vindicated by the success of the RQFII.	RQFII 的成功印证了我们的理念。
Fees and charges income during 2006/07 increased significantly due to volume increases in the underlying work performed and licenses issued.	由于本会所进行的相关工作量及发出牌照的数目增加，因此 2006/07 年度的收费收入大幅上升。
I would like to discuss the following four aspects today: - Current status of the Hong Kong securities and futures markets - Regulatory philosophy of the SFC - CEPA – Current status and development - Way forward for CEPA Hong Kong as the largest stock market in Asia (ex-Japan) The growth of the Hong Kong stock market has been encouraging since the recovery of the local economy in 2004.	今天，我希望与大家分享以下 4 方面的内容 - 香港证券及期货市场的现状 - 香港证监会的监管理念 - CEPA 的现状及发展 - 有关 CEPA 的进一步工作 香港是亚洲第一大股票市场（除日本以外） 自 2004 年香港经济复苏以来，香港的证券市场有著令人鼓舞的发展。

Some hedge fund managers tell me that greater transparency could reveal their trading strategies or proprietary technologies, or could expose them to populist or political backlash.	有些对冲基金经理告诉我，提高透明度可能会导致他们的交易策略或自行研发的技术要被迫披露于人前，或令他们受到民众或政客的抨击。
These range from disclosure of interests breaches to unlicensed dealing or advising, and from cold calling to market manipulation.	这些罪行由违反披露权益规定到无牌交易或无牌提供意见，及由自荐造访到操纵市场不等。
The importance of title is beyond doubt, as properties are the cornerstone of any REIT.	业权的重要性毋庸置疑，因为物业是任何房地产基金的基石。

We mustn’t forget that when it comes to testing reform initiatives, there is another consideration.	我们不要忘记，当涉及测试改革措施时还要顾及另一个因素。
Under the new arrangements, the SFC may request assistance from the CSRC in obtaining information in the Mainland for SFC investigations.	根据最新的安排，香港证监会可请求中国证监会协助在内地获取其调查所需的信息。
These funds therefore had the potential to cause serious disruption to our market and loss of investor confidence.	该些基金因而有潜在力量严重扰乱本港巿场及使投资者失去信心。
Regulation alone would not deliver a quality market unless investors also play an active monitoring role.	除非投资者亦积极參与监察工作，否则单靠监管法规本身并不足以建立优质的市场。
However, the analogy must hold true that provided we can find ways for RMB debt to be created in Hong Kong and for the debt proceeds to be used for investment or trade purposes, thus earning a return, we would have established the fundamentals necessary to creating real RMB assets in Hong Kong.	如果我们能够找到方法在香港发展人民币债券业务，并利用债券收益作投资或贸易用途，从而赚取回报，我们就可以打下必要的基础，在香港创造真正的人民币资产。

Now I would like to turn to the question of the specific role of the SFC in this regard.	现在，我要转到证监会在这方面所担当的特定角色的问题上。
Last week’s proposals by the US Treasury to improve regulatory coordination and oversight and to modernise the regulatory structure are the most sweeping overhaul since the Depression.	而上星期，美国财政部提出一系列建议，希望改善监管部门之间的协调，完善监管制度，令监管架构更趋现代化。 这是大萧条之后影响最深远的一次改革。
So I thought this would be an opportune time to reflect on the basic yet essential role that market regulators play in tackling misconduct in capital markets and how that ties in with our current regulatory approach at the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).	因此，我认为，现在是适当的时候反思市场监管机构在处理资本市场的失当行为时所扮演的基本和不可或缺的角色，以及有关角色如何与证券及期货事务监察委员会（证监会）的现行监管方针相互结合。

And with the increased presence of Mainland-backed, SFC-licensed corporations and Hong Kong-listed Mainland companies, the regulatory interests of the SFC and the CSRC are increasingly aligned.	此外，随著愈来愈多的中资公司获证监会发牌，而在香港上市的内地公司数目亦有所增加，证监会与中国证监会的监管目标已渐趋一致。

While some may argue that the RMB liberalization journey began as early as 1994, when the Mainland opened up its current account, it remains a fact that the RMB only ventured out of the Mainland’s doors in 2004, when the Mainland allowed Hong Kong banks to accept RMB deposits from Hong Kong individuals, and to clear RMB with the PBOC Shenzhen Branch, with a limit of RMB 20,000 per day per customer.	也许有人会认为，人民币早于 1994 年就已开始对外开放，因为中国在这一年开放了人民币经常项目，但实际上人民币到了 2004 年才在境外流通。 当年内地允许香港的银行接纳人民币个人存款，与中国人民银行深圳分行进行人民币结算，而每名客户每日兑换的上限为 20,000 元人民币。

While banks in Hong Kong could provide trade finance to corporates, and this would have enabled the banks to create loans and thus RMB assets, they have not been able to do much in this sector because the use of RMB as a trade settlement currency has been extremely skewed.	香港的银行虽可向企业提供贸易融资，从而创造贷款业务及人民币资产，但这方面的业务却未能大幅拓展，这是因为人民币作为贸易结算货币的使用出现了一面倒的情况。

Because of the highly technical content and opacity of some of these projects, it is hard for an average investor to pick winners, a job more suited for professional investors such as venture capital funds.	鉴于这些项目有部分涉及大量技术内容且透明度低，一般投资者难以辨别哪些才是卓越的项目，而这项工作，会较为适合专业投资者（例如创业投资基金）。
Risk measurement and risk management by market participants play a critical role in contributing to financial stability.	市场参与者如何量度及管理风险对于维持金融稳定性发挥著举足轻重的作用。
In other cases, we found that investors with limited or no investment knowledge or experience invested in complex investment products whose product issuers were domiciled overseas.	在其他个案中，我们发现只具备有限或全无投资知识或投资经验的投资者曾投资于复杂的投资产品上，而相关产品的发行人是在海外注册成立的。

2016 saw the continued development of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and asset management centre.	回顾 2016 年，香港作为国际金融中心及资产管理中心持续发展。
A robust and effective but fair regulatory regime;	健全、有效而公正的监管制度；
If we look at what the Mainland has achieved in a short space of 30 years, and we have all heard the saying that time and tide wait for no man (or country for that matter), then maybe it doesn’t seem so farfetched after all.	但是，回想到内地在短短 30 年间所取得的成就，加上俗语亦有云﹕岁月不饶人（或者在这里应该把人说成国家），到头来这些目标似乎并非那么遥不可及。
For example, the studies commended Hong Kong on its enforcement regulation, but indicated that there is room for improvement on corporate governance culture, the political and regulatory environment.	举例说，该些研究赞扬香港的法规执行，但却指出香港在企业管治文化、政治及监管环境方面有改善的空间。
As even a cursory reader of the Financial Times soon notes, UK listed companies release information about the trading performance throughout the year.	只要大家粗略翻阅一下《金融时报》，很快便会发现英国的上市公司在全年任何时间都会发表有关公司业绩表现的信息。
In contrast the UK FSA announced last month that it will not be requiring use of XBRL.	相反，英国金融服务管理局上月则宣布将不会要求使用 XBRL。
Our hedge fund survey You may be interested to know that we recently carried out a survey on all our licensed hedge fund managers on the hedge funds that they manage or advise.	证监会的对冲基金调查 你可能有兴趣知道，证监会最近完成了一项对所有持牌对冲基金经理的调查，内容包括他们所管理或提供意见的对冲基金。

Unsubstantiated claims by the applicants that they had introduced or would introduce new products to the market and that the products were expected to be successful;	申请人作出没有根据的声称，指他们曾经或将会在巿场推出新产品，并预期该产品会成功；

In other words, RMB must first establish itself as an international investment currency, a currency that can be used to store international capital outside the Mainland.	换言之，必须先确立人民币作为国际投资货币的地位，让人民币成为可用以在中国境外储存国际资本的货币。
This includes, for instance, any swap or other derivative counterparties to your fund.	当中包括基金的掉期交易或衍生工具交易对手。
As I previously mentioned, the role of the Executive Chairman has been changed to a nonexecutive one which means that the Chairman, in his new capacity, would have more time to devote to leading the Board and to communicate more frequently with the stakeholders.	正如我以上所提及，执行主席的角色已改为非执行性质，意味著主席在新的岗位上会有更多时间集中于领导董事局及更频密地与各相关团体沟通。
28. What the SFC is doing is to look closely at how we discharge our statutory role with a view to cutting back red tape and unnecessary bureaucracy.	28. 证监会正对履行有关法定职责的方式作出详细检视，从而减少繁文缛节和避免不必要的官僚作风。
That might explain why big banks with wide retail distribution networks account for the sales of over 80% of investment funds in Hong Kong.	这或许能够说明为何在本港的投资基金销售额中，有超过八成是来自拥有广阔零售分销网络的大型银行。
You may ask why the NAV of SFC-authorised funds (totalling US$910 billion) is different from the amount of combined asset management business of US$789 billion reported in the FMAS over the same period.	大家可能会问，为甚么证监会认可基金的资产净值(合共 9,100 亿美元)，不相等于同期的基金管理活动调查所报告的 7,890 亿美元资产管理业务合并资产总值呢？
Although many have stressed the speculative and destabilising nature of hedge funds, there are hedge funds and alternative investment managers with a strong record of successful long term investment.	虽然很多人都强调对冲基金带有投机及导致不稳定的性质，但仍有对冲基金及另类投资经理成功地进行长远投资并取得辉煌的成绩。
In fact, the Western world and the Chinese economy are looking to Hong Kong to help them match their needs.	事实上，西方各国与内地均希望能够借助香港市场的优势，有效地配合各方的需求。
Hong Kong also sees a significant deposits figure of HK$5.9 trillion as at November of last year.	而香港截至去年 11 月的存款总额亦达 59,000 亿港元，數目相当可观。
These moves appear to have calmed markets, but whether they are sufficient to restore market stability remains to be seen.	这些措施看来有助安抚市场，但是否足以令市场恢复稳定则仍是未知之数。

Investors sold securities to repay their Yen loans, and the unwinding of the Yen carry trades reinforced the market decline and strengthened the Yen further.	投资者被迫沽出证券以偿还日圆贷款，而日圆利差交易的平仓活动则加速市场下跌，并使日圆进一步转强。

If the Bank Manager was worried about risk on a loan, he would call the borrower in for a chat, preferably before lunch.	若银行经理对贷款风险感到忧虑，他便会叫借款人前来洽谈――最好在午膳之前。
From this baseline, we are gradually building up our expertise in investment portfolio management.	在这个基础上，我们逐步建立了投资组合管理方面的专业知识。
Instead, the investment advisers relied on disclaimer statements signed by the investors confirming that they invested in these products without any advice from the investment advisers.	相反，投资顾问依赖投资者所签署的免责声明，以确认他们是在没有听取投资顾问的意见的情况下而投资于该等产品的。

But platform sales are not without issues, such as data privacy, outsourcing, and remote account opening and know-your-client (KYC).	然而，平台销售并非不无问题，当中涉及到资料私隐、外判，以及遥距开户并进行认识你的客户程序等事宜。
Expansion of the investment product market in Hong Kong The range of investment products available to retail investors has continued to grow. For example, we authorized the first ETF managed by the Hong Kong asset management subsidiary of a Mainland insurance group in April this year.	扩展香港的投资产品市场 散户投资者可选择的投资产品愈来愈多，例如，今年四月，证监会认可了首只由内地保险集团旗下的香港资产管理附属公司管理的 ETF，到了今年 10 月，我们认可了首只由本地公司管理，并在香港的保险库储存黄金的黄金 ETF。

As investors prosper, the intermediaries will flourish and the whole market will benefit.	随著投资者获益，中介人的业务亦将蒸蒸日上，整个巿场将会因而受惠。

By 2009, I felt that it was the right time to introduce this concept.	到了 2009 年，我觉得提出这个理念的时机到了。
In the past, we did not spell out precisely who was regarded as senior management. But before approving a corporate licence application, we did require the corporation to appoint two Responsible Officers, or ROs, to be responsible and accountable for good governance and proper behaviour.	过去，证监会并无明确界定何谓高级管理层，但我们要求法团申请人须委任两名负责人员就良好的管治和恰当的行为负上责任并接受问责，方可获发牌照。

This just shows how open our market is to overseas products and firms.	在证监会认可的 1,800 个基金中，只有大约 300 个是在香港注册成立的，这说明了本港市场对海外产品与公司是何等开放。

Does all this sound too good to be true?	以上所说的是不是好像过于理想，不太真实？
The structure of Hong Kong’s securities industry is quite unique in that it has not only the top investment banks and securities brokers from the advanced markets, but it has also a large population of local stockbrokers of various sizes.	香港的证券业架构相当独特，不单有來自先进市场的大型投资银行和证券经纪公司，也有大量规模不一的本地经纪行。
The SFC directly supervises SFC-licensed IAs only, whereas the HKMA is the frontline regulator for registered institutions (i.e. banks) that are IAs.	证监会只负责直接监管获其发牌的投资顾问，而金管局则是担任投资顾问的注册机构（即银行）的前线监管机构。

Worse still, regulators are blamed all the same when the very event they were warning the market against actually happens.	更糟的是，一旦所预警的事情变成事实，监管机构却会受到责难。
It is therefore uniquely placed to help China experiment and manage the risks along the way. The process started as early as 2004 when banks based in Hong Kong (and Macau) were allowed to open RMB deposit accounts for individuals. Each individual could exchange up to RMB20,000 per day, and the deposit-taking banks could clear these RMB positions with the People’s Bank of China.	早于 2004 年，以香港（及澳门）为基地的银行已获准为个人客户开立人民币存款户口，个人客户每天最多可兑换人民币 20,000 元，而接受存款的银行可就这些人民币存款与中国人民银行进行结算。

Today, as US consumer demand shrinks and Chinese labour costs continue to rise, that model is fast becoming obsolete.	今天，随著美国消费需求萎缩及内地勞工成本不断上涨，上述的发展模式已变得不合时宜。
Given China’s prominence in the global economy, it is both natural and appropriate for China to step up its internationalization strategy.	由于中国在全球经济体中举足轻重，加快实现国际化是必然且适当的策略。
Today, we will issue another circular to all licensed firms, inviting them to send representatives to our workshops to be held in February and March.	我们今天将会向所有持牌法团发出另一份通函，邀请持牌法团派代表出席本会在 2 月和 3 月举行的工作坊。

I am sure the veteran fund managers among the audience here could not have imagined such milestone developments to have taken place so quickly.	我相信在座当中的资深基金经理也未必意料到这么快便出现如此突破性的发展。
It was because for most of the funds (including hedge funds) in Hong Kong, they rarely held financial instruments related to the US sub-prime market.	基金公司亦没有客户进行大额赎回，因为大部份香港的基金 (包括对冲基金在内)都极少持有与美国次按有关的金融产品。
If there is no improvement, we would not hesitate to impose licensing conditions or to issue a restriction notice if warranted.	假如情况没有改善，我们会毫不犹豫地施加发牌条件，或在必要时，发出限制通知书。
You have all helped to make Hong Kong what it is today. I hope you will join hands with us as we seek to bring home the fruits of the new initiatives that we have identified for this coming year.	香港拥有今天的成就，大家功不可没。 希望大家继续与本会携手合作，协助我们在來年落实各项新措施。

Today, some of our local names have become significant regional or even global players in their own rights.	今天，部分本地參与者已凭著本身的实力，成为区内甚至全球市场上举足轻重的一员。
We do not, for example, intend changing the regulatory regime that is currently applicable to currency-linked and interest rate-linked products which are banking transactions or treasury instruments of banks.	举例说，我们并不打算改变目前适用于货币挂钩及利率挂钩产品的监管制度； 这些产品属银行交易或银行库存工具。
Hence, one of our regulatory approaches is to promote self-discipline among intermediaries.	因此，我们的监管方针之一是培养中介人自律。
(iii) Thirdly, we encourage the industry to offer more investor education.	(iii) 第三，我们鼓励业界提供更多投资者教育。
Industry wanted minimal interference in this area, but as we have seen sometimes the incentive structures encouraged excessive risk taking by staff in order to earn huge bonuses.	虽然业界并不希望在这方面受到干预，但我们見到有时候这种奖勵方式会令员工为了取得丰厚的花红而不惜承担过高风险。
Compare this with the combined NYSE/NASDAQ market cap is only 1.3 times US GDP.	反观美国纽约证券交易所和纳斯达克市场，两个市场的上市公司市值合计仅为美国本地生产总值的 1.3 倍。
(1) Strong capital base As at the end of 2005, shareholders’ funds of Hong Kong securities firms reached HK$80 billion in total, up nearly 30% from that in 2003.	(1) 证券公司资本基础雄厚 截至 2005 年底，香港证券公司的股东资本总值达 800 亿港币，较 2003 年增长近 30%。

At the same time, we would tighten regulations, or re-regulate, where the regulations are deficient in achieving the desired regulatory outcomes, again because of changes in the operating environment, loopholes or regulatory gaps.	同时，若因经营环境出现转变，或监管制度出现漏洞或不足之处，以致监管规例未能达到预期的监管效果，我们也会加强监管或重新制订监管规则。
Algorithmic programmes now use a vast number of hidden layers to process large, unstructured data sets to drive investment decisions.	当今的算法程式使用大量隐层来处理大型非结构化数据集，以作出投资决定。
We believe that these factors may provide tailwinds or impetus for ETFs to gain critical mass, in or through the Hong Kong market.	我们相信，这些因素或有助推动和加快 ETF 的发展，进而在香港或通过香港的市场取得关键性的量化增长。
To succeed in playing and maintaining this role, we must preserve the quality of our market and regulation.	要成功担当并维持这个桥梁角色，我们必顸致力维持市场及监管的素质。
I hope the trend is becoming clear to you.	希望各位能够清楚洞悉个中的趋势发展。
While we acknowledge that innovative technologies such as blockchain have the potential to improve efficiency and financial inclusion, that does not entitle anyone to conduct fundraising from the public in violation of securities law.	虽然我们明白，创新科技（例如区块链技术）或可提升效能并使金融服务更为普及，但这并不表示任何人有权在违反证券法例的情况下进行众筹。
This cooperation enabled us to manage common risks better and laid the foundation to develop Hong Kong as a centre for managing exposure to the Mainland market.	这项合作不但让我们能更有效地管理共同的风险，而且为香港发展成为内地市场相关风险的管理中心奠定了基础。
With the launch of the UCITs III platform since 2002, however, fund managers are no longer confined to a set of simple investment restrictions.	然而，随著 UCITS III 平台在 2002 年推出，基金经理不再受制于一套简单的投资规限。

Some of them have expressed interest in filing or have already filed their applications with the CSRC.	自从 CEPA 第二阶段正式推行以来，我们知道有些香港期货公司已开始和内地期货公司就以合资方式合作进行磋商，当中有些已表示有意，或者已经向中国证监会提出申请。

Regulatory landscape The relevant standards of conduct are contained in the SFC Code of Conduct. The Code applies equally to banks and SFC licensees.	监管制度证监会的《操守准则》载有相关的行为操守准则，当中的守则同样适用于银行及证监会的持牌人。
While it may have been possible for non-executive directors to argue in 1990s that they are only expected to do little more than attending a few board meetings, and perhaps some of the board committees that are established, such arguments are not likely to hold water today.	在 90 年代，非执行董事可能认为只须出席几次董事局会议或一些已成立的董事局委员会便已足够，但在今日这种论调已不合时宜。
The Mainland financial sector clearly needs to do a better job at directing hard-earned savings to more productive uses.	无容置疑的是，内地金融界必须使这些得来不易的储蓄用得其所。

While it is the job of the REIT managers to grow their REITs, we, as the regulator, will do what we can to facilitate this.	虽然促进房地产基金增长是房地产基金经理的工作，但我们作为监管机构将会致力利便这方面的发展。
Investor education is an important complement to regulation, as it helps to empower the investor with basic knowledge of products and risks, of their own rights and responsibilities, as well as channels for complaints in case of unfair treatment or misconduct. Enlightened investors would be equipped to ask the right questions, make informed decisions and be more alert to scams.	投资者教育与监管规例之间可互相补足。 透过教育，投资者能掌握产品的基本知識和风险，明白他们的权利和责任，在遇到不公平对待或失当行为时，也知道有甚么投诉渠道。 向投资者灌输相关知識，他们便懂得提出适当的问题、作出有根据的决定及对欺诈活动有更高的警觉性。
Following this philosophy, our fund regulation platform is built on three principles:	根据这项理念，我们的基金监管制度亦建基于三大原则：

 market participants that embrace international norms and practices;	市场参与者所奉行的国际化规章制度；
We are now working with the Government to amend the law.	我们现正与政府合作修订有关法例。
Ensuring investors have appropriate knowledge regarding their investments The second way to protect investors is to make sure that they are armed with the knowledge to understand what they are investing in.	确保投资者对所作的投资有适当认识保障投资者的另一方法，是确保他们对所投资的产品有所认识。
To keep up, we have to adjust our supervisory priorities and our tools and approaches.	为了与时并进，我们必须调整本会的监察工作重点、措施和方针。
In terms of human resources and services, Hong Kong possesses a rich pool of talent and can offer a comprehensive set of skills, experience and advisory services for Mainland institutions seeking to invest overseas.	在人力资源和服务方面，香港拥有大量专才，亦可为拟进行海外投资的内地机构提供全面的技术、经验和顾问服务。

The issuers escape the scrutiny of the police or securities regulators because of their crossborder nature and the way the crypto assets are structured to fall outside any regulator’s perimeter.	基于发行人的跨境性质，以及加密资产的结构安排，它们并不受任何监管机构的管辖，故发行人能够避过警方或监管机构的监察。
Through arbitrage activities and willingness to deploy innovative investment strategies, they play a valuable role in reducing or eliminating mispricing and market anomalies.	对冲基金透过套戥活动及由于乐意采纳创新的投资策略，在减少或消除错误厘定价格及巿场异常现象方面担当著不可多得的角色。

Regarding investor protection, we act as a gatekeeper to ensure that only fit and proper person with sufficient knowledge in Hong Kong regulatory framework could provide regulated activities.	在投资者保障方面，我们担当把关者的角色，确保只有符合适当人选资格且对香港的监管架构具备充分认识的人才可提供受规管活动。
Below the heading are the three principal areas of work of the SFC:	这个标题下面的就是证监会三个主要工作范畴：
REITs are first and foremost steady yield plays and alternative investments with lower correlation to the equities market.	房地产基金主要是一种能够提供稳定回报及与股票市场的相关性较低的另類投资项目。
In terms of investment channels for the currency, having RMB-denominated products is not sufficient in itself.	要将人民币计价产品发展成一个蓬勃的市场，在需求方面，我们必须相应地扩展人民币计价产品的投资者基础。
We must ensure that our investor education efforts meet the varying needs of our growing and more diverse investor base.	我们必须确保我们的投资者教育工作满足我们不断增长、更趋多元化的投资社群的不同需要。
Not only this, Hong Kong has been drawing increasing numbers of fund managers, attracted no doubt by the depth and breadth of our market, the transparent and customerfocused approach of our regulation, and the enormous opportunities in mainland China, the needs of which Hong Kong is in a unique position to serve.	此外，愈来愈多基金经理选择来港经营业务，究其原因，无非是因为本港市场既深且广、本会的监管方针具透明度和以客为本，以及香港可借助本身的独特位置去满足中国内地所需，从而享受到内地市场提供的庞大商机。
Earlier this year, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicated that it planned to review the use of derivatives by ETFs, mutual funds and other investment companies.	美国证券交易委员会（证交会）今年早前亦表示打算检讨 ETF、互惠基金及其他投资公司使用衍生工具的情况。
This is further evidenced in the Supplement IV to CEPA signed by the HKSAR Government and the Mainland last week.	而上星期特区政府及内地签署的 CEPA 补充协议四，亦是另一证明。
30. The above is the story as it has unfolded since July. You would be very much aware of the impact on Hong Kong.	30. 以上是由 7 月至今的事态发展，相信各位都十分清楚香港所受到的冲击。
We should therefore introduce appropriate regulations to protect consumers’ interests accordingly.	所以，我们应该订立相应的法规保护消费者的权益。
By 2010, in slightly over a decade, China had climbed to second place.	到了 2010 年，中国在短短十年间已攀升至第二位。
The Mainland therefore has a strategic interest in Hong Kong’s continued development as an international financial centre.	因此，如香港能继续其作为国际金融中心的发展，便能符合内地的策略性利益。
38. Third, we have also worked on ensuring that our enforcement powers are adequate and our actions are transparent.	38. 第三，我们亦致力确保我们有充足的执法权力，及我们的行动具备透明度。

In the past, you were never timid about coming up to me to share what the latest trends were, and what we should work on to open up more market prospects and opportunities for you.	各位过去总是樂意前來向我讲述最新的市场趋势，以及我们应在为基金业开拓市场前景及商机方面进行甚么工作。

Starting with only one product, the HSI Future, in 1988 with annual trading of 140,000 contracts, last year we saw 25.5 million futures contracts traded.	衍生产品市场的飞跃发展亦非常显著，由最初即在 1988 年，只有恒指期货一项产品、每年交投量仅为 14 万张合约，发展至去年录得的全年期货合约交投量达 2,550 万张。
Of course, supply of and demand for RMB-denominated products and RMB financial transactions cannot be developed in a vacuum.	当然，增加人民币计价产品的供求，促进以人民币结算的金融交易，需要实质条件配合。
27. Here comes my third and final area to cover today – the regulatory response to the challenge of ensuring investors’ confidence.	27. 以下是我今天涵盖的第三及最后一个范畴－对确保投资者信心这项挑战作出的监管回应。
This structure also reflects the profile of the investors and issuers.	这架构也反映出投资者和发行人的概况。
16. Another area where there was a call for less or no regulation was in respect of hedge funds, as they brought in huge business to prime brokers and helped to create deeper and more liquid markets.	16. 此外，市场亦要求放宽甚至取消对对冲基金的监管，因为对冲基金给主要经纪行带來巨额生意，且有助提高市场的深度和流动性。

Hong Kong’s role in RMB internationalisation  Hong Kong has been a successful testing ground for the Mainland financial reforms – it is an important fund-raising platform for Mainland enterprises cum a channel for the outflow of Mainland capital  Hong Kong can play a key role in promoting the wider use of RMB in the international market, whilst the Mainland keeps the capital account under control  Hong Kong as an offshore RMB centre:	香港在人民币国际化进程中所扮演的角色 香港作为国家金融改革的试验场，也同时为内地企业提供了一个 重要的集资平台，并且也是资金“走出去”的桥梁 香港可大力推广和促进人民币在国际市场中的广泛使用，与此同 时，内地仍可继续实行资本管制的措施 香港作为一个是人民币离岸中心：

13. (Slide 2) Unlike the EAA, the SFC regulates a wide scope of activities, which fall into three main groups:	13. ( 附图二 ) 跟地产代理监管局不同的是，证监会监管的对象较广，大家从图表可以见到，被证监会监管的主要为三个类别：
REIT managers may have questions on various aspects of the REIT Code, which is a principle-based code to give the SFC flexibility in applying the regulations to this new product.	房地产基金经理可能会遇到有关《房地产投资信托基金守则》(《房地产基金守则》) 不同层面的疑问，因为该守则以原则为本，旨在给予证监会在对房地产基金应用有关规定时的靈活性。

We were the first regulator to sign MOUs with all the Mainland financial regulators, CSRC, CBRC and CIRC.	我们是首家与所有内地金融监管机构，即中国证监会、中国银监会及中国保监会签订谅解备忘录的监管机构。
Thirdly, this is an initiative of great significance for both Hong Kong and the Mainland. It cannot and should not be rushed.	最后，这项措施对香港和内地而言，均具有重大意义，因此不能也不应操之过急。
They are required to comply with the codes, rules and regulations issued by the SFC and subject to the SFC’s extensive ongoing supervision of their financial position and conduct etc.	所有持牌人都须遵守证监会颁布的所有法规及守则，并接受证监会在财务及操守风险方面的多方面持续监察。
The second factor is the export of capital by the Mainland and its investors, looking for investment and risk diversification.	第二个因素是内地和其投资者为寻求投资机会及分散风险，而将资金投放其他市场。
Let’s start on the domestic front. When I joined the SFC in 1998, the Mainland had already experienced a decade of heady growth.	当我在 1998 年加入证监会的时候，内地刚好经历了十年的惊人增长，但当时尚未成为今天的经济龙头。

My priorities Many of you may remember that, when I took up this appointment three months ago, I set out four of my priorities:	我的首要工作 在座当中不少人或会记得，三个月前我在接受这项任命当日为自己订立了四项首要工作：
Equally significant is that as the market becomes more sophisticated, and therefore more unforgiving to the average retail investor, more and more investors rely on investment advisers or IAs to guide them through the complex range of financial products, to find those that are reasonably suitable and appropriate for them.	同样显著的是，随著市场变得愈趋复杂，一般散户投资者感到无从入手，以致愈来愈多投资者倚赖投资顾问指点迷津，希望从五花八门的金融产品中挑选出较适合他们的产品。
Now … with all the euphoria about markets – it is easy to forget the fundamental purpose of a stock market.	眼前的市场一片兴旺—很容易令人忘却证券市场的基本作用。
In fact, synthetic ETFs have provided investors with a wider range of investment opportunities and choices, in particular the opportunity of investing in a relatively easy manner in markets otherwise restricted to them.	其实合成 ETF 带来了更多投资机会及选择，尤其是投资者可透过合成 ETF 以较简单的方式参与本来无法参与的市场。
Of course, investors must assess potential investments in light of their own needs and financial situations.	当然，投资者必须按照自己的需要及财务状况评估潜在的投资机会。
Some of investment advisers involved were unable to demonstrate why such investments were considered suitable to the clients concerned.	一些涉及该等个案的投资顾问更未能证明为何该等投资会被视为适合有关的客户。
That’s a lot more aggressive that just sitting back and watching value grow – but ideally the outcome is the same – better returns.	抱持这种心态的人较只打算坐享其成的人远为进取，但理想的结果都是一样—更佳的回报。
The general view was that the uptick rule may have been introduced for good reasons 10 years ago as a deterrent to abusive short selling in extreme market conditions.	一般认为限价沽空在十年前制定时，旨在遏止投机者在极端市况下肆意沽空，原意是无可厚非的。
For those applications that were taken up, the processing time attributable to applicants consistently exceeds 60% of the total processing time.	而在已接纳的申请中，因申请人而造成的处理时间持续占总处理时间逾 60%。
In particular, Shanghai has been earmarked to become an international financial centre by 2020 and the recently established Free Trade Zone indicates that some of the market liberalisation measures may first be tested there.	尤其是，内地已规划在 2020 年之前把上海打造成为国际金融中心，而上海最近设立自由贸易区，亦显示部分市场开放措施可能率先在该自由贸易区内试行。
Likewise, they make for the exits to minimise losses.	同样，他们也会为减少亏损而離场。
The Hong Kong platform for fund raising by Mainland enterprises has helped to boost the status of Hong Kong as an IFC.	内地企业利用香港作为集资的平台，更进一步巩固了香港作为国际金融中心的地位。
To assist investors we have advised all note issuers to pass on to distributors all information that may materially affect the issuers’ ability to perform their obligations, including any credit downgrade of the underlying reference entities of the collateral.	为协助投资者，我们已建议所有票据发行商向分销商提供所有可能严重影响发行商履行责任能力的资料，包括抵押品的相关參考机构被调低信贷评级的消息。
The sub-prime mortgage loans or their MBS are further repackaged into debt securities with different tranches of risk or credit rating, and return to meet the different risk appetites of investors.	次级按揭贷款或其按揭证券会被进一步重新包装成为多批具备不同风险或信贷评级及回报率的债务证券，以切合投资者的不同风险承受能力。
Conclusion I hope I have given you some idea of the key issues that I believe are the most likely to have an impact on Hong Kong’s fund management industry.	结语 以上我与大家分享了我相信会对香港基金管理业带来影响的重要因素。
SFC’s regulatory philosophy As a securities regulator, the role of the SFC is to maintain a regulatory framework with international standards and market integrity.	证监会的规管理念 证监会作为证券监管者的角色，是要维持与国际标准看齐的监管制度及市场的廉洁稳健。

Hong Kong has included a market development objective in the Securities and Futures Ordinance (SFO). It provides for the SFC to promote a competitive securities industry and to be mindful of the need for Hong Kong to remain competitive as an IFC, over and above the normal objectives of securities regulation.	在香港，《证券及期货条例》也订下市场发展目标，规定证监会须建立具竞争力的证券业，及时刻紧记要维持香港作为国际金融中心的竞争力，这目标超越了一般的证券监管目标。
With higher life expectancy, rising healthcare costs and an ageing population, there is a need to ensure that there is sufficient accumulation and growth of assets to support a life style they are accustomed to.	随著人口的预期寿命更长、医療成本上涨，加上人口老化，他们需要确保资产得到充分的累积和增长，以维持本身已习惯的生活方式。
I am confident that more achievements are to be made as the market develops, given the presence of a rich pool of talents in Hong Kong, the world class legal and regulatory system that Hong Kong has established, and the expertise that Hong Kong has developed in investments in assets and business in China, which is predicted by the market to be the long term source of growth potential for REITs.	随著房地产基金市场日渐发展，加上香港人才济济、已建立起达世界级水准的法律及监管制度，以及香港在中国内地资产及业务投资方面所累积的专业知识，又鉴于市场预期内地将会为房地产基金提供长远的增长潜力，我深信，香港房地产基金市场必定会续创佳绩。
