This notion was first put forward by the Qing-dynasty painter Shi Tao（1641-1718？）, though his ideas were controversial among contemporary scholars and artists. Shi, drawing inspiration from Daoist philosophy and Chan (Zen) theory, and perhaps from Fu Xi's use of a single line to symbolize yin and yang as a unitary whole in creating the eight trigrams (eight combinations of three whole or broken lines formerly used in divination), held that all things in the universe derive from a single oneness. All tangible things under a painter's brush, likewise, forever have that oneness at their core. For him, oneness means naught. Painting is thus a process of generating tangible objects from nothing. This is also the ultimate Dao -- a combination of the way of painting with that of all things in the universe. As well, oneness is a set of broadly applicable rules present throughout the process of painting. Each stroke or line reflects these rules. The oneness in painting theory encompasses multiple relationships between oneness on the one hand, and the Dao, nothingness, tangibility, and multiplicity on the other.

The former aims high whereas the latter never violates moral laws.’ Did  Confucius not want to befriend people who pursue the Middle Way when he  said this? An adherent to the Middle way is not easy to find; that is probably why he settled for meeting people somewhat lower in stature.”(Mencius)Do not seek for physical pleasures, for they are too low and are the behaviors of  common people.

In the old days, it was stressed that a work of calligraphy or a painting should have a bone (structure) and be fleshy and that there should be a proper balance between the bone and flesh. There should neither be a lack of elegance nor of vigor and strength. Therefore, “fleshy body and a soft bone structure” is regarded as a demerit.

By the Tang Dynasty, because calligraphers put more emphasis on the different forms and skills of calligraphy, they started to use a new term “calligraphic technique.” Calligraphic technique represented an initial stage of calligraphy – a tangible, superficial and somewhat “lower” level.

By the end of the Southern Song Dynasty, however, the academies became increasingly government-oriented and were linked with the imperial civil examination system. The rise and decline of the academies was in harmony with the rise and decline of the School of Principle during the Song and Ming dynasties.

Besides demanding close observation and experience of natural objects prior to painting, such as that the various forms within the picture will be laid out appropriately, it also demands solid technical proficiency in order that the artistic intent be formed in imagination before taking shape in painting. Freehand brushwork is divided into greater freehand and lesser freehand, with the former often employing the ink-splashing technique.

It opposed rigidly rhythmical prose featuring parallelism and excessive elegance that had been popular in the Six Dynasties, and advocated a return to writing in “truly” classical Chinese. This movement was both intellectual and social in nature. Its representative figures included Han Yu (768-824) and Liu Zongyuan (773-819) of the Tang Dynasty and Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072), Su Xun (1009-1066), Wang Anshi (1021-1086), Zeng Gong (1019-1083), Su Shi (1037-1101), and Su Zhe (1039-1112) of the Song Dynasty. In this particular context, the notion of classical prose stood in contrast to rigidly rhythmical prose. Classical prose, first proposed by Han Yu, referred to the prose of the Qin, Western Han, and Eastern Han dynasties. It featured poetic lines of flexible lengths with no particular regard for metric pattern and parallel structure. In terms of content, classical prose aimed to express ideas and reflect real life. Rigidly rhythmical prose, on the other hand, was a style of writing popular in the pre-Tang period which had rigid requirement about the use of parallelism, elegant wording, prosody, melody, and allusions. Although there were good works in this genre, most were rigid in form and hollow in content. In view of this, Han Yu called for a return to the literary tradition of the Western and Eastern Han dynasties to reform literary writing. He gained the strong support of eminent men of letters such as Liu Zongyuan. Together, they launched what was later widely known as the Classical Prose Movement. Han Yu took this initiative to combine the reform of literary writing with the revival of Confucian moralism so as to enable literary writing to promote better governance. But rhythmical prose did not die out altogether; it continued into the late Tang period. Northern Song writer Ouyang Xiu, with strong political influence, championed the revival of classical prose. His contemporary Su Xun, as well as his students Wang Anshi, Zeng Gong, Su Shi, and Su Zhe all wrote classical prose with distinctive styles. Influenced by Su Shi, Huang Tingjian (1045-1105), Chen Shidao (1053-1102), Zhang Lei (1054-1114), Qin Guan (1049-1100), and Chao Buzhi (1053-1110) also became prominent prose writers.

Later, what the officials in charge of keeping records of historical incidents or events or collections of these incidents or events as well as comments about them are also called shi (史), which literally means history. According to Xu Shen, the original pictograph representing the Chinese character shi looks like a hand kept in the middle, which means keeping records of historical incidents or events objectively without lending favor to any side of an issue. Great emphasis was once placed on keeping records of history, and during certain periods, even the sovereign rulers were not allowed to interfere with the work of officials in charge of keeping records of historical incidents or events. On the one hand, by keeping records of historical incidents or events, such officials posed a deterrent to rulers, who had to be careful about what they said and what they did.

Yang Xiong (53 BC-AD 18) of the Han Dynasty expounded this idea more systematically.

Yet, another ancient Chinese philosopher  Laozi believes that a great man should abandon ostentatious rites and norms, and return to the natural state through non-action.", "【引例】": "【CITATIONS】", "居天下之广居，立天下之正位，行天下之大道；得志，与民由之；不得志， 独行其道。富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈，此之谓大丈夫。（《孟子·滕文公下》）（居处在天下最广阔的住所，立身于天下最恰当的位置，遵行天下的大道。 得志的时候，与民众一起遵行大道；不得志的时候，独自遵行其道。富贵不能使其行止失度，贫贱不能使其改变遵行的原则，权势不能使其屈服。这就是所谓的“大丈夫”。）夫礼者，忠信之薄而乱之首。前识者，道之华而愚之始。是以大丈夫处其厚，不居其薄；处其实，不居其华。故去彼取此。（《 老子·三十八章》）（礼，标志着忠信的不足，是祸乱的端始。预设的种种规范，是道的浮华， 是愚昧的端始。因此大丈夫处事敦厚，不为浇薄；处事朴实，不为浮华。 所以舍弃浇薄浮华，而采取敦厚朴实的方式。）": "Living in the broad residence under heaven, staying in the proper place under heaven, one should observe the essential Dao under heaven. When havingachieved one’s ambitions, one should practice Dao along with the people; when failing to succeed in one’s ambitions, one should observe Dao alone. Neither riches nor honors can corrupt him; neither poverty nor humbleness can make him swerve from his principles; neither threat nor force can subdue him. Such a person can be called a great man.(Mencius)Rites indicate a lack of loyalty and sincerity, and portend disorder. Preset norms are ostentatious representations of Dao and usher in stupidity. So a great man should be earnest rather than superficial, be simple rather than ostentatious. Such a person abandons everything superficial or ostentatious, and leads a simple and honest life.(Laozi)"}, {"大体/小体（dàtǐ/xiǎotǐ）": "The Major Organ and the Minor Organs", "孟子（前372？—前289）对心与感觉器官的称谓，用于对大人与小人的区分。耳、目等感觉器官为“小体”，耳目之官不具备思考与辨别的能力，因此在与外物的接触中易受外物牵引。人如果仅仅依循于“小体”，则会陷于物欲，是为小人。心为“大体”，心天生具有思考与辨别的能力。人如果能够确立“大体”的主导性，则可以通过心的作用，发现并不断扩充心中固有的善端，不为物欲所蒙蔽，是为大人。": "Referring to the heart and the sensory organs, this term was used by Mencius (372?-289 BC）to differentiate between men of virtue and petty men.

In Laozi's view, the key to whether or not states can coexist peacefully lies in whether or not great ones can refrain from bullying small and weak ones. If they can lower themselves and treat small states with modesty, they will display the capacity to accommodate the entire world. This will cause small states to trust them and look up to them, just as all tributaries flow toward great rivers.

A low position is where everything in the world meets, where the world's feminine and gentle elements gather. The feminine and gentle elements often triumph over the masculine and powerful through stillness, and it is stillness which keeps it in the lower position. Thus when a great state treats a small state with modesty,it can win the trust and following of the latter. When a smaller state treats a greater one humbly, it can win its acceptance and tolerance. Hence by behaving modestly,great states win the trust and following of small ones, while small states win acceptance and tolerance from great ones.

Second,dadaois not something separate and far away from reality. Rather, it is a practical ethical principle which is easy for people to follow in their daily lives.

In pre-modern China, all under heaven referred to the whole territory of China ruled either directly or nominally by the Son of Heaven. By “state” Gu Yanwu, however, meant something entirely different: the state only refers to one imperial house, while “all under heaven” refers to the whole of the Chinese nation and Chinese civilization.

Secondly, mandate of heaven means fate, which is irresistible and imposes limit on human power. Thirdly, the term indicates the natural disposition bestowed by heaven upon human being.

Liu Xie (465?-520) of the Southern Dynasties observed that this kind of writing was prepared for making an oral presentation to the emperor.

Humans are prone to pursue excessive desire, which can be harmful to themselves, cause problems with others and lead to social disorder. This is why both Confucian and Taoist scholars called for restraining desires.

A fief was smaller than the territory under the direct control of the lord. While obeying the rule of the lord, a dukedom enjoyed a high degree of autonomy in its military and administrative affairs. Dukedoms checked each other in the protection of the lord. A dukedom might be passed down genetically upon the approval of the lord and was required to pay tribute to him. As a political system, feudalism is believed to have started in the era of the legendary Yellow Emperor, and became established in the Western Zhou Dynasty. Feudalism was akin to the patriarchal clan system based on blood ties and gave rise to a hierarchy system. After the first emperor of Qin（259-210 BC） reunified China, he abolished feudalism in favor of the system of prefectures and counties.

One is a grand sacrificial ceremony held in ancient times by an emperor after ascending to the top of Mount Taishan to pay tribute to heaven and earth, announce his achievements, thank gods for having brought him and his people good fortune, and inscribe his achievements on a huge stone. He performed this ceremony to declare to the world that his power was bestowed by Heaven. A heaven-worshipping ceremony was held on an earthen terrace on the top of Mount Taishan. An earth-worshipping ceremony was held on a clearing on the Liangfu or the   \tYunyun Hill near Mount Taishan. According to legend, the Three Sovereigns and the Five Emperors, hero Yu who brought floods under control, King Tang of the Shang Dynasty, King Wu of the Zhou Dynasty (?-1043 BC) all held such ceremonies during their reigns. After the founding of the Qin Dynasty, only the First Emperor of Qin (259-210 BC), Emperor Wu of the Western Han Dynasty (156-87 BC), and Emperor Guangwu of the Eastern Han Dynasty (5 BC-AD 57) held such ceremonies on Mount Taishan.   \t   \tThe other meaning of this term is an ode composed to urge the emperor to hold such a sacrificial ceremony or to record its actual process if a sacrificial ceremony was held to extol his achievements. Such an ode was first written by Sima Xiangru (179?-118 BC) of the Western Han Dynasty. Liu Xie (465?-520) of the Southern Dynasties held that the ode, as a declaration of royal achievement in its era, should be solemn, grand, factual, eloquent and graceful. To extol an emperor's greatness and the miraculous power of heaven and earth, the author should select old yet lucid words from the classics, or use new words rich in implication. He should give free rein to his imagination. Sacrificial odes later became standard commemorative speeches.

In such arrow shooting contests, archers must not only try hard to hit the target, they also needed to maintain the right stance and attitude.

In terms of genre, traditional Chinese fiction is divided into literary sketches, legendary tales, story- tellers’ prompt-books, and chapter-based novels. In terms of language, there is fiction in the classical language and vernacular fiction. Traditional Chinese fiction has evolved through different stages, with distinctive features for each period. The myths, legends and historical biographies of the pre-Qin and Han dynasties, and the fables in the works of the earlier Chinese thinkers were the sources of traditional Chinese fiction. The literary sketches by men of letters in the Wei, Jin, Northern and Southern dynasties were embryonic forms of traditional fiction. The legendary tales of the Tang Dynasty marked the eventual emergence of Chinese fiction. The story-tellers’ prompt-books in the Song and Yuan dynasties laid the foundation that allowed traditional fiction to reach maturity.

Proceeding from an artistic perspective, Zhong deemed poems by Cao Zhi (192-232) as \"having a mixed quality of grace and sorrow.\" He stressed that a poet should guard against excess emotion and obey the rule of proper grace. As for how to understand the notion of \"graceful sorrow,\" there are two somewhat different interpretations. According to the first, the emphasis of that notion is on sorrow; namely, Cao's poems seek to voice suppressed grief, despite a restrained, proper style of expression. The second interpretation says that \"grace\" and \"sorrow\" here are of equal weight, insisting that Cao's poems are both aggrieved and graceful.

Feng emphasized that \"feeling\" is an instinct or natural inclination of humans, starting with affection between man and woman and then spreading to relationships between monarch and ministers, father and son, or brothers and friends. Without true feeling, a literary work cannot touch the heart and morally edify people. In imbuing moral instruction with true feeling, Feng did not intend to do away with ethical reasoning. In fact, he held that true feeling is far more fundamental and authentic, adhering more closely to human nature.

If he turns his back on the law and abnegates his power, society will fall into disorder.(Hanfeizi)"}, {"拟容取心（nǐróng-qǔxīn）": "Comparing Appearances to Grasp the Essence", "指诗人在采取比兴手法的时候，通过类比、描摹事物的形象外貌，摄取事物内在的意蕴和义理，从而将原本不同的事物联系、结合在一起。“拟容”说的是重视“比兴”的具体形象；“取心”说的是摄取事物的精神实质，即重视事物形象所包含的内在意蕴和理趣。合起来的意思是，借助能表达一定意义的事物形象，来寄寓、抒写作者的思想感情。见于《文心雕龙·比兴》，由《周易·系辞上》中的“拟物立象”发展而来。刘勰（465？—520年）提出这一术语，主要用以阐释比、兴都是由彼及此，二者又有不同：比为“拟容”，重在贴合事理，忌不伦不类；兴为“取心”，重在感发幽微，以意相联。": "This term means a poet uses the techniques of analogy and stimulation to depict the form and the external appearance of things. He takes in internal connotations and the principles of things, thus linking originally different things and combining them. Nirong (拟容comparing appearances) attaches importance to specific forms for bixing (比兴 analogy and stimulation). While quxin (取心 grasping the essence) aims to get at the spirit and the essence of things, it therefore attaches importance to internal connotations and to the principles contained in the form of things. The combined meaning is that by giving expression to the form of things with a certain meaning, one may imply and express his thoughts and feelings. This notion appeared in The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons. It developed from niwu lixiang (拟物立象 create images through object imitation) in The Book of Changes. Liu Xie (465?-520) first used this term, mainly to explain that analogy and stimulation are inter-connected but are different: Analogy here means “comparing appearances.” Staying true to the principle of things is most important, and anything far-fetched should be avoided. Stimulation means “grasping the essence,” sensing the abstruse and being connected with the meaning.", "【引例】": "【CITATIONS】", "诗人比兴，触物圆览。物虽胡越，合则肝胆。拟容取心，断辞必敢。攒杂咏歌，如川之涣。（刘勰《文心雕龙·比兴》）（诗人在运用比兴手法的时候，能够具体周密地接触、观察事物。即使事物的差异很大，像胡、越 一样遥不相及，用比兴合在一起却如同肝胆那样密切。比拟、描摹事物的外在形象，摄取事物的内在意蕴和理趣，判断和措辞一定要果断明白。把繁杂纷纭的事物用比兴纳入诗歌，文思就如同河水一样畅快流淌。）取象曰比，取义曰兴，义即象下之意。（释皎然《诗式·用事》）（从事物的外部形象方面着眼是“比”，从事物的内在意蕴方面着眼是“兴”，而意蕴就含在形象之中。）": "When a poet uses analogy and stimulation, he comes into close contact with things and observes them thoroughly. Things may be quite disorganized, but when combined they tend to show themselves to be intimately linked. When comparing appearances to grasp the essence of things, one should be concise and resolute in forming judgment. When one incorporates various things in recitations and songs, they will swell and flow like a river.（Liu Xie:The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons）Analogy means comparing the appearances of things, while stimulation means grasping the essence of things.

Firstly, from the pre-Qin period to the end of the Eastern Han Dynasty, it meant knowledge of ancient literature, especially that of humanities including poetry, history, rites and music, as well as works of laws and regulations.  Starting from the Wei and Jin dynasties, the term basically became equivalent to today’s concept of literature, but it also referred to academic writings on humanities. With the introduction of the Western concept of literature in recent history, the term gradually evolved to mean a pursuit that uses language to create aesthetic images. However, a few scholars, such as Zhang Taiyan（1869—1936）, stuck to its traditional definition. The original meaning of the term determined the mainstream view on literature in contemporary China, which focuses on examining a literary phenomenon in the broader cultural context and emphasizing the intrinsic relationship between the aesthetic values of literature and liberal arts. This is somewhat different from the Western notion of literature which highlights the independent nature of literary appreciation.

It has been flourishing to this day. If divided by historical periods, regular script falls into two styles: Wei stone tablet regular script and Tang regular script.

Free from harms by demons and sages, people stand to gain all benefits.(Laozi)"}, {"法（fǎ）": "Law/ Dharma", "“法”的本义指刑罚，引申而指法律、法令和法律制度。在古代中国，“法”和“礼”都是对人行为的规范；“礼” （礼教）旨在扬善；“法”（刑罚）旨在惩恶。古人认为，“法”虽由君王制定和颁布，但是君王和天下的人须共同遵守，它体现了法的正义性与公平性。公元前536年，郑国执政子产（？— 前522）将郑国的法律条文铸在象征诸侯权力的鼎上，史称“铸刑书”，这是中国历史上第一次向民众发布成文法。战国时期，产生了以商鞅（前390 ？— 前338）、韩非子（前280 ？—前233）为代表的法家学说。“法” （dharma）又为佛教术语。在佛教典籍中，“法”主要有三种含义：其一，指真实的存在，即真知的对象。佛教认为日常事物都是依待各种条件合成的，表象所见悉皆不实，通过修行，可以观见其中不可再分的真实要素，包括物质、意识功能等要素上百种。其二，指如实的教导。它既是佛陀言说的教法，也是听法者应当实现的目标。这一观念与阿毗达摩之法相的具体含义虽然有别，却并不相违，因为对于真实的认识基于相应的教导。这些不仅是佛教知识体系的重要组成部分，也是实现解脱的基础。其三，指世间现象。不同于上述指向解脱的法，佛教典籍中亦有“诸法”“万法”的说法，在最宽泛的意义上指世间一切现象，它们是不真实的。": "The Chinese character fa (法), originally meaning “penalty,” refers to the legal system consisting of laws, decrees, and regulations. In ancient China, both fa and li (礼rite) set standards for individual behavior. In particular, rites rewarded virtue, while laws punished vice. It was generally accepted that while only a sovereign ruler had the right to enact and promulgate laws, everyone, be it a ruler or a subject, had to obey the laws. This point of view reflects the justice and fairness of law. In 536 BC, Zichan (?-522 BC), the chief minister in the State of Zheng, had the legal provisions cast on a bronze ding, a tripodal vessel that symbolized the power of the ducal ruler. Zichan’s action, known as “casting the penal code,” was the very first example of publishing a statute in Chinese history. The Warring States Period witnessed the rise of the Legalists such as Shang Yang (390?-338 BC) and Hanfeizi (280?-233 BC).   \tFa (法) is also a Buddhist term. In scriptures, it is the Chinese equivalent of the Sanskrit word dharma with three shades of meaning. First, it refers to real being, which is the object of genuine knowledge. Buddhism argues that all things in daily life are produced through the concomitance of causes and conditions. In this sense, what one appears to see or know is unreal in nature. However, one can perceive the dharmas, the indivisible real elements beneath the surface, through mental practices. Indeed, there are more than a hundred types of the elements, such as substance and consciousness. Second, dharma can be defined as the Buddhist teachings. The teachings here not only refer to the words dictated by the Buddha but also what dharma-hearers receive and pursue. This point of view is different from the characteristics of dharma discussed in the Abhidhamma Pitaka (Basket of Advanced Dharma). But they do not contradict each other, because both of them advocate that perception of reality be based on relevant teachings. For Buddhism as a whole, the teachings constitute a significant portion of its knowledge system; for all Buddhists, the teachings pave the way for their personal liberation. Third, dharma denotes the worldly phenomenon, which is clearly distinguishable from the previous meaning. In scriptures, zhufa (all dharmas) and wanfa (tens of thousands of dharmas) represent all worldly phenomena, unreal in nature, in the broadest sense.", "【引例】": "【CITATIONS】", "法者，刑罚也，所以禁强暴也。（桓宽《盐铁论·诏圣》）（法就是刑罚，是用来禁止强暴的。）夫礼禁未然之前，法施已然之后。（《史记·太史公自序》）（礼的作用是阻止作恶之事发生，法则是在作恶之事发生之后进行惩罚。）心、心所法亦非实我，不恒相续，待众缘故。（《成唯识论》卷一）（意识和由意识产生的各种心智功能也都不是真实的自我，因为这些法都依待各种条件产生，并不能恒久持续。）": "Laws are punishments for the purpose of prohibiting violence and crime.(Huan Kuan:Discourses on Salt and Iron)Rites are practiced before crimes can be committed, while laws as punishments are enforced afterwards.(Records of the Historian)Neither mind nor its resulting mental factors belong to the real self.

This expression means since everything is constantly changing and evolving,   institutions, laws and rites must change correspondingly. It opposes being bound by tradition, favors innovation and change, and espouses the basic principle that a country’s governance should follow the times and respond to popular will.

By this I mean that, while knowing all the rules for poetry, the poet goes beyond them to reflect unpredictable changes in his poetry yet without compromising the rules. The principle underlying this way of writing is that there should be set rules, yet they are not fixed; where there seem to be no rules, rules do exist. You can discuss literary flexibility with others only if they understand this principle.(Lü Benzhong: Foreword toThe Collected Poetry of Xia Junfu)In writing essays, it is necessary to maintain literary flexibility. If one is bound by the clichés of the classical masters and fails to produce novel ideas, this is what we call literary rigidity. Literary rigidity refers to mechanically copying others without permitting one’s own work to acquire new ideas. Literary flexibility, however, allows one’s work to free itself from clichés so that the work will not be stifled by stereotyped style of writing. Literary rigidity leads to a literary dead end, while literary flexibility encourages the birth of new ideas by going beyond the limitations of conventional way of writing.(Yu Cheng:Reflections from Devoted Reading)"}, {"浑沌（hùndùn）": "Chaos", "“浑沌”又作“混沌”，有两种不同含义：其一，指天地分化形成以前宇宙浑然一体的状态。常以未分化之“气”言之。天地万物皆由“浑沌”分化演变而成。其二，特指《庄子》一则寓言中的中央之帝。中央之帝浑沌无七窍，被南海之帝儵（shū）和北海之帝忽凿开七窍而亡。庄子（前369？—前286）以此形象寓指人无知无识、无善恶彼我之分，与整个世界浑然一体的状态。": "The term has two meanings.

Denseness and lightness are relative to each other. In traditional Chinese painting, for example, the colors chosen can either be dense or light, but they should not be so dense as to be crude or so light as to be insipid. Ink wash painting pays particular attention to the denseness or lightness of color, aiming to achieve a balance between the two. This implies a harmony between the bright and the shady, the front and the rear views, the tangible and the intangible, density and sparsity, and the long- and short-range views.

The theory of inner self used in Ming- and Qing-dynasty poetics was influenced by this idea.", "【引例】": "【CITATIONS】", "观古今胜语，多非补假，皆由直寻。（钟嵘《诗品》卷中）（综观古今名篇佳句，大都不是借用前人诗句或使用典故，而是直接从自身体验中寻求而得。）我手写我口，古岂能拘牵？（黄遵宪《杂感》其二）（我要用我的文字来表达我想说的意思，怎么能够为古人文章的思想内容和文字形式所束缚？）": "A comprehensive survey of the best-known works of ancient and current poets shows that most of the poets did not borrow favored lines or literary allusions from their predecessors, but directly sought inspirations from their personal experiences.(Zhong Rong:The Critique of Poetry)Since I want to use my own words to express my feelings, how can I let myself be bound by the content and forms of ancient writings?(Huang Zunxian: Five Poems on Random Thoughts)"}, {"相反相成（xiāngfǎn-xiāngchéng）": "Being both Opposite and Complementary", "处于对立关系中的两个事物之间既相互排斥又相互成就、相互转化。一切事物都处于与他者的对立之中。对立双方具有相反的性质或意义，因而彼此间是相互排斥的，如有与无、长与短、高与下、善与恶、美与丑等。但同时，事物的性质或意义又是借由与之对立的事物而获得确立的，对立双方在一定条件下还可以相互转化。这一观念在先秦时期即已出现，在班固（32—92）《汉书·艺文志》中始被概括为“相反相成”。": "This term refers to two things that are mutually opposite to but complementing each other and that they mutually transform between them.

The way to achieve such result is to create healthy and harmonious relationships among people and let them speak their minds without fear so those in power can benefit from their various opinions and valuable insights. Even when the criticism from the general public or one’s subordinates is not fully justified, those in leading positions should take warning rather than condemning the critics.", "【引例】": "【CITATIONS】", "上以风化下，下以风刺上，主文而谲谏，言之者无罪，闻之者足以戒，故曰“风”。（《毛诗序》）（执政者用风诗教化百姓，百姓也用风诗讥刺执政者，用富于文采的诗歌对执政者含蓄委婉地进行劝讽，歌咏的人不会因此获罪，听闻诗歌的人足以引起警诫，所以将这类诗称作“风”。）言者无罪，闻者作戒。言者闻者，莫不两尽其心焉。（白居易《与元九书》）（说的人没有罪责，听的人引以为戒。说者和听者双方都一心想着把事情做好。）": "Rulers usefeng(ballads) to cultivate the people and the people use them to ridicule the rulers.

The term yi (议 commentary) refers to an official discussion and analysis of state affairs with the emperor to air one’s views, often different from that held by the emperor and other officials, and propose solutions. The term dui (对 proposal) refers to the act of proposing strategies and answering the emperor’s questions. These two terms are discussed together in the“Commentary and Proposal” section of The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons. The general term “commentary and proposal” encompasses all types of official writing. According to Liu Xie (465?-520) of the Southern Dynasties, to produce a good piece of official writing, one should have a good knowledge of ancient and current institutions as well as codes of law and major examples, identify problems, objectively and logically analyze them, and propose feasible solutions. Such writing should not be pompous in style or ignore facts. Liu Xie stressed that commentaries and proposals should be based on solid facts and result-oriented and that one who wrote them should have vision and talent.

They believed that in an ideal society, the land should belong to all its people, and there should be mutual trust, cooperation and harmonious relations between people and between states. “Keeping good faith and pursuing harmony” subsequently became an ethical norm advocated by Confucian scholars; it later also became an important Chinese cultural norm governing relations between people and between states.", "【引例】": "【CITATION】", "大道之行也，天下为（wéi）公。选贤与能，讲信修睦。（《礼记·礼运》）（大道实行的时代，天下为天下人所共有。品德高尚、才能突出的人被选拔出来管理社会，人与人之间讲求诚实与和睦。）": "When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all the people.

Instead, one should have his independent views. One should draw his own persuasive conclusion on a theory or a subject by way of reasoning on the basis of numerous facts. He should find support in classics and other relevant sources, draw on previous scholarly reflection and explore an issue comprehensively and elaborately. The wording of such an essay, whose aim is to convince its readers, should be candid and sincere; such an essay should expound truths and uphold the cardinal principle of righteousness. It should increase its persuasive power and emotional appeal by using rhetorical devices and citing concrete examples. But such an essay should not be written to please the readers against one's own will, nor should it be designed to mislead them. One who writes an essay of argument and persuasion should, as Liu Xie pointed out, arrive at a truth through independent thinking, basing his judgment on his own views and conscience.

Generally regarded as a school of idealism, Yogācāra, literally “mind only,” argues that all worldly phenomena are actually shaped by consciousness, which can be divided into at least two parts: the seeing and the seen.

The six fundamental types of sensory consciousness of the eyes, the ears, the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind respectively perceive form, sound, smell, taste, shape, and dharma. The seventh type of consciousness is kliṣṭamanovijñāna (“deluded consciousness”), and the eighth ālāyavijñāna (“storehouse consciousness”). Kliṣṭamanovijñāna performs a function of constant reflection, on which the consciousness of the mind is posited. It also persistently conceives ālāyavijñāna as the physical self. Ālayavijñāna, the repository of the seeds of karma, keeps the purity of all types of consciousness from being contaminated, even though they are in a state of contamination themselves.

First, it refers to any work that offers commentaries on ci poets, poems, schools of ci poetry, the gist of a ci poem and textual criticisms. This type of work is a constituent part of scholarly inquiry into classical Chinese poetry. Criticism on ci poetry, with relatively long lines interspersed with shorter ones, are derived from criticism on the more usual type of classic Chinese poetry with a fixed number of characters to a line.

Although superficially it imitates the traditional way of offering commentaries onshipoetry and ci poetry, it in fact already attempts to construct a theoretic system. It has remained the most influential work of literary criticism since the late-Qing period.    \tSecond, the termcihua also refers to an art of theatrical performance combining narratives and songs popular in the Yuan and Ming dynasties, in which the ci part is the singing of rhymed verse. As in Tales of Prince Qin of the Great Tang Dynasty, the performance intersperses singing with narrative, and verse with prose. It was developed from the performance of story-telling with speech and song of the Song Dynasty.

Dong Zhongshu raised this idea to provide theoretical support for such divergence. As a view of literary theory, it is concerned with different readers’ divergent interpretations of a text and its aesthetic values. This view argues that as poetic terms are suggestive, ambiguous, and intricate, readers should not settle for a superficial understanding of a poem. Instead, they should delve into the poet’s heart and develop their own understanding, interpretation, and insight of his poem.

If not, the poet is only showing the poverty of content to his readers.(Liang Qichao: Notes on Poets and Poetry from the Ice-drinker's Studio)Among all poets today, Huang Zunxian figures prominently, because he incorporates new ideas into the old form.(Liang Qichao: Notes on Poets and Poetry from the Ice-drinker’s Studio)"}, {"诗穷而后工（shīqióngérhòugōng）": "A Good Poem Is the Product of Pent-up Emotions.", "诗人只有在遭受困厄艰险的环境中，幽愤郁积于心，方能写出上乘的诗歌作品。这里的“穷”，并非指物质生活上的“穷困”，而是指广义的人生逆境。“工”，工致精美。这一命题由北宋著名文坛领袖欧阳修（1007－1072）提出。欧阳修认为，诗人因人生逆境而能对现实利益有所超脱，这有助于诗人抒写出曲折入微而又带有普遍性的世况人情。欧阳修的“诗穷而后工”继承发展了司马迁（前145或前135？—？）的“发愤著书”说与韩愈（768—824）的“不平则鸣”说，但它不再强调诗人自身愤懑的宣泄，而是揭示了优秀诗歌作品之所以产生的规律。欧阳修之后，此说成为文学批评理论中关于优秀文学作品产生规律的带有普遍意义的说法。": "A poet will be able to produce a quality poem only when he is in a difficult and perilous environment, feeling suffocated with pent-up anger and frustration. The wordqiong(穷 difficulty) does not mean the physical deprivation of material means but refers more broadly to adverse situations in life.Gong(工 quality) means artistically refined and beautiful. This idea was put forward by Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072), a renowned leader in the literary world of the Northern Song Dynasty. He believes that adverse situations will enable poets to transcend the desire for worldly gains and assist them to depict with sophistication and insight scenes and people in the real world that have a universal significance. Ouyang Xiu’s theory not only continues but also develops Sima Qian’s (145 or 135?-? BC) “indignation spurs one to write great works” and Han Yu’s (768-824) “cry out against injustice.” This concept no longer focuses on expressing the poet’s own indignation or frustration but seeks instead to shed light on the way a great poem comes into being. Later on, the proposition became a mainstream theory in literary criticism regarding the origins of literary masterpieces.", "【引例】": "【CITATION】", "予闻世谓诗人少达而多穷，夫岂然哉！盖世所传诗者，多出于古穷人之辞也。……盖愈穷则愈工。然则非诗之能穷人，殆穷者而后工也。（欧阳修《梅圣俞诗集序》）（我听到世人说，诗人很少有仕途通达的，大多人生不顺。果真是这样吗？大概是世间流传的那些诗，多是出于古代不得志的诗人们的创作吧。……大概诗人越是命运不顺，他们的诗就写得越是精美。这样看来，并不是写诗让人命运不顺，恐怕是诗人命运不顺，然后做的诗才精美吧。）": "I hear that poets seldom fare well in their pursuit of official positions.

First, it refers to any work that contains critiques or commentaries on poets, poems, schools of poetry, anecdotes about poets, and textual research. This type of work is a constituent part of scholarly inquiry into classical Chinese poetry. The tradition of offering commentaries on poetry had its origin in “The Critique of Poetry” by Zhong Rong (?-518?) of the Liang Period of the Southern Dynasties. The first somewhat complete commentary on poetry and poets wasOuyang Xiu’s Criticism of Poetry, by Ouyang Xiu (1007-1072) of the Northern Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty’s most renowned work of poetry commentary, which also had the greatest influence on scholars of later generations, wasCanglang’s Criticism on Poetryby Yan Yu (?-1264) of the Southern Song Dynasty. After that, notes of this kind became a principal medium through which to offer commentaries on poetry and propose theories of poetry composition. The Ming and Qing dynasties boasted the largest number of works of poetry commentary. The best of such works wereDesultory Remarks on Poetry fromGinger Studioby Wang Fuzhi (1619-1692) andSuiyuan Remarks on Poetryby Yuan Mei (1716-1798), both from the Qing Dynasty. During the Ming and Qing periods,Commentaries on Poetryfrom Past Dynasties,A Sequel to Commentaries on Poetry from Past DynastiesandQing Dynasty Commentaries on Poetrywere also published, all of which contain important works of poetry critiquing of all dynasties. Commentaries/critiques on poetry essentially shun a comprehensive and elaborate theoretical system and focus instead on articulating the critic’s personal, nuanced appreciation and evaluation of poetry. Each of them contains only a few terse remarks, airing views on finer points in poetic composition and revealing personal feelings and thoughts on rules governing artistic creation. Commentaries on poetry are themselves highly literary and deserve to be appreciated from that perspective. Such commentaries on poetry, with their distinctly Chinese cultural features, distinguish themselves from Western scholars’ obsession with systematic construction of literary theories and strictly scientific modes of expression. Second, the termshihuamay also refer to a kind of age-old art of theatrical performance that intersperse singing with narrative, and verse with prose. Rhymed verse, which normally consists of seven characters to a line, is employed for singing. Prose, on the other hand, is used as in vernacular speech.

It was no longer confined to temples, but became a form of popular entertainment on stages and at marketplaces. It included many subgenres such as histories based on works of authors of the Han to the Tang dynasties, skits with talking and singing, farces, stories of the Three Kingdoms and stories of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms. In the Southern Song Dynasty, tale telling covered four subjects: stories told to the accompaniment of a wind instrument, war stories, histories of past dynasties as well as Buddhist allegories and tales about wise thoughts inspired by worshipping at shrines. Tale telling entertainers were good at talking, singing and telling jokes; and drums, gongs and other musical instruments were used to enhance the appeal. Poetic lines were read and an anecdote was told at the beginning of the show, a trick used by performers that drew cheers and applause from early comers and ensured that late arrivals would not miss the main show.

Northern Song writer Fan Zhongyan（989-1052） created this school with hiscilyric, A Fisherman's Song, which grew into a major poetic style thanks mainly to Su Shi's contribution. After the Central Plains fell to the Jin forces, the Song court fled south of the Yangtze River and was too weak to recover the lost territory.

They voiced their patriotic sentiments and identified their own fate with that of the whole nation. They thus enrichedcilyrics’ ways of expression and greatly lifted its status in the history of literature.

They ruled by brutal force instead of by the force of morality; they governed by coercion instead of moral suasion. They ignored ethics and made people live in fear. All they cared for was the benefits to their own states. Such practices went against the philosophy of the Chinese nation that has all along upheld peace and harmony, not force.

Later, it came to refer to the function of shaping customary social practices, namely, the educational role of literary and artistic works in changing social behaviors and popular culture. Originating from “Introductions toMao’s Version of The Book of Songs,” the term is one of the important concepts of the Confucian school on the function of the arts. It believes that poetry and music have a role to play in shaping people’s mind, reflecting the notion that rulers can educate and influence the general public by imparting a particular ideology in a top-down fashion, thereby achieving the desired effect of cultivating the general culture. The influence of this concept is far-reaching； it has impacted much of artistic creation in China, all the way from the poetry and music of the pre-Qin period to literary and artistic works in the modern times. It not only reflects the Confucian view on moral education, but also imparts a sense of social responsibility on writers and artists. However, if an artistic work overemphasizes moral cultivation, it runs the risk of placing ideology before artistic form, thus compromising its aesthetic value.

In his essay titled “Subsequent Commentaries on Calligraphy,” Jiang Kui (1155?-1209) of the Song Dynasty further argued, on the basis of the concept of “vim and vigor,” that the merit of a calligraphic work is jointly determined by the calligrapher’s moral character, origin of his style, skill, innovation and the kind of brush and paper he uses.
